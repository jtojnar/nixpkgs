/* NOTE:
   fetchgit has one problem: git fetch only works for refs.
   This is because fetching arbitrary (maybe dangling) commits may be a security risk
   and checking whether a commit belongs to a ref is expensive. This may
   change in the future when some caching is added to git (?)
   Usually refs are either tags (refs/tags/*) or branches (refs/heads/*)
   Cloning branches will make the hash check fail when there is an update.
   But not all patches we want can be accessed by tags.

   The workaround is getting the last n commits so that it's likely that they
   still contain the hash we want.

   for now : increase depth iteratively (TODO)

   real fix: ask git folks to add a
   git fetch $HASH contained in $BRANCH
   facility because checking that $HASH is contained in $BRANCH is less
   expensive than fetching --depth $N.
   Even if git folks implemented this feature soon it may take years until
   server admins start using the new version?
